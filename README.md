üéì Welcome to My Final Project Collection!

Hi there! Welcome to my collection of academic projects. This repo showcases some of the exciting things I've worked on during my graduate studies, blending applied mathematics, scientific computing, and machine learning. Here's a quick look at each project and what makes them interesting:

üìÇ Projects You‚Äôll Find Here

1Ô∏è‚É£ Electron in a Potential Well Simulation (2021)

Course: Numerical Methods II (MTH 538 in SUNY UB)

What I Did: I simulated the behavior of an electron trapped in a potential well using numerical methods. This involved solving eigenvalue problems to find energy states and wavefunctions.

Tech & Skills: Numerical PDEs, Eigenvalue Algorithms, MATLAB/Python.

2Ô∏è‚É£ MTH 649 Project: PINNs to solve PDEs (2023)

Course: Graduate PDEs (MTH 649 in SUNY UB)

What I Did: Built a Physics-Informed Neural Network to solve complex Partial Differential Equations by embedding physical laws directly into neural network training. It's a cool intersection of physics and deep learning!

Tech & Skills: PINNs, PyTorch, Scientific Computing.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Predicting Bitcoin Prices with Machine Learning (LSTM)

Course: Machine Learning in Finance (MTH 563 in SUNY UB)

What I Did: Used an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict Bitcoin prices based on past data. Compared with the predictions of Facebook Prophet.

Tech & Skills: Machine Learning, LSTM, Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Financial Modeling.
